                <pullquote>Rapidly rotating neutron stars, called pulsars, were discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967. This discovery was recognized by the award of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics, but despite being the first person to discover pulsars, Burnell was not one of the recipients of the prize.</pullquote>

                <pullquote>Women working at the Dagenham Ford Factories staged a strike in 1968 to campaign for equal pay. The majority of the women striking worked as sewing machinists to make car seat covers. As stock ran out, production halted at nearly all the UK Ford automobile plants. This strike led to the founding of the National Joint Action Campaign Committee for Womenâ€™s Equal Rights.</pullquote>
